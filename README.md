# Omega_BSD

OmegaBSD is a documentation-first exploration of operating system behavior,
focusing on efficiency, determinism, and stability.

Current focus:
-> Bootloader behavior
-> System startup flow
-> UI responsiveness foundations

Development philosophy:
-> Document before modifying
-> Avoid kernel changes until behavior is understood
-> Prefer reproducibility over speed

This project currently targets FreeBSD as a reference platform.
